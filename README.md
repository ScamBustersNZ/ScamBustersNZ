- 👋 Hi, I’m @ScamBustersNZ
- 👀 I’m interested in Scambaiting, and bringing scammers to their knees- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Kali.. and how to program in Linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scambaiting with like minded people like @kitboga. 
- :) I'd love to hear from anyone who has scambaiting tools - Flooders, bombers, phishing, DOS, exploitation, virus creation etc- 📫 How to reach me ...
